## LittleSichuan – Online Family Kitchen Platform
A fully-featured and responsive web application that allows home-based chefs to list traditional Sichuan dishes and customers to browse, order, and track meals. This was a full-stack solo project inspired by the idea of supporting local family chefs and delivering authentic food experiences through a modern, easy-to-use interface.

## Demo


## Design
The LittleSichuan platform was designed with a focus on simplicity, responsiveness, and clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend.
The frontend is built with React.js, styled using MUI (Material UI) and custom inline/CSS module styles. The design follows a clean, modern look inspired by real-world food delivery platforms.
React Router enables a single-page application experience, and Context API is used to manage global state (such as cart contents) across pages.
On the backend, a Node.js + Express server handles all API endpoints. TypeORM connects to a MySQL database and abstracts entity relationships.
All communication between frontend and backend is handled through Axios.
